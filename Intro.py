"""Unlike regression where you predict a continuous number, you use classification to predict a category. There is a wide variety of classification applications from medicine to marketing. Classification models include linear models like Logistic Regression, SVM, and nonlinear ones like K-NN, Kernel SVM and Random Forests.

In this part, you will understand and learn how to implement the following Machine Learning Classification models:

    Logistic Regression
    K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN)
    Support Vector Machine (SVM)
    Kernel SVM
    Naive Bayes
    Decision Tree Classification
    Random Forest Classification


Enjoy Machine Learning!"""
